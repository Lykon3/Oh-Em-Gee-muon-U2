# TSR Framework

![Oh-Em-Gee-muon-U2 Banner](README_IMAGE.jpg)

This repository contains research and simulation materials for the **TSR (Tension-Shape-Resonance) theoretical frameworks**, a theoretical structure proposed by $dadRaps.

The project aims to explore:

- Recursive plasma tension geometries
- Vacuum geometry overlap factors
- Muon g−2 anomaly implications
- SHA256 verification hashes
- Simulation output from solving g-2 scenarios
